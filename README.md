## 🚀 Laboratory Works

### Lab 1: HTTP File Server with TCP Sockets
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Score:** 10/10 points  

**Objectives:**
- Implement HTTP server using raw TCP sockets
- Support multiple file types (HTML, PNG, PDF)
- Handle HTTP requests and generate proper responses
- Implement HTTP client for testing
- Generate directory listings with nested navigation
- Deploy using Docker Compose

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Core HTTP/1.1 server implementation
- ✅ HTTP client with CLI interface (+2 bonus pts)
- ✅ Auto-generated directory listings (+2 bonus pts)
- ✅ Network-ready for peer-to-peer sharing (+1 bonus pt)
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Security measures (path traversal protection)

**Technologies:** Python, TCP Sockets, HTTP/1.1, Docker, Docker Compose
